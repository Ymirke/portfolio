            Before becoming a software developer I worked as a digital marketer.
            I really enjoyed creating small scripts and tools that I used in my
            work. Eventually creating scripts were more fun to me than anything
            else, so I started programming as much as possible.

            This is around the time I heard about{' '}
            <a className="Header__links" href="https://salt.dev/">
              School of Applied Technology
            </a>
            . Which is a bootcamp with 500+ coding hours. Test driven
            development, daily standups as well as weekly retrospectives and demos.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I love about programming is being able to be creative and build
            things that are useful to other people.
